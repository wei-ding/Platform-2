diagnosis of RA on the available data at this time but I have to assume the 
rheumatologist had some additional information (for example hand x-rays and

REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
 
Palliative Care was asked to see Mrs. **NAME[AAA] for goals.

She is a **AGE[in 70s]-year-old African-American woman with a history of end-stage renal
 disease, secondary to diabetes; coronary artery disease, status post CABG:
 recurrent cellulitis; status post right BKA; and currently postoperative day
 four status post flap closure of a right upper extremity wound. 
 
As stated above, we are consulted for some pain management, as well as
 discussion regarding goals of care with her family. At the

that the IV Dilaudid and Roxicet possibly could
 be contributing to a change in mental status. The other concerns for Mrs.
 **NAME[AAA] include swallowing difficulty, she 
 
is NPO, as she has not a good effort in her swelling; as well as, poor wound
 healing, likely secondary to malnutrition and end-stage diabetes.
 
Per Dr. **NAME[TTT], it is unlikely she may improve much beyond her current level of
 function. 
 
Our resident spoke to the patient's sister **NAME[SSS], who is a CRNA in **PLACE,
 at **INSTITUTION. Per her report, Mrs. **NAME[AAA] had been living in assisted

and that she displayed more
 forgetfulness. She also thinks that her mental status markedly decreased
 after the BKA and it took her 3-4 weeks to improve some, but she did notice
 the improvement. She could interact and sing 3-4 weeks after the BKA.
 
Her sister is well aware that her diabetes is severe and she has suffered
 end-organ damage and that her function might not improve much, but her goal
 is that she could interact more with her family. Her sister feels that she
 should be a DNR/DNI; however, the patient's son **NAME[RRR] is her power of attorney
 and we have

VII is 1.2.   
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
Our impression of Ms. **NAME[AAA] is that she is a **AGE[in 60s]-year-old woman with a history 
of a DVT and PE, who has a fairly sizable intracranial hemorrhage likely 
secondary to hypertension are our thoughts given its location.  She has 
stroke risk factors including diabetes mellitus and likely  hypertension.  
She also has a remote history of a DVT and PE, and she has been on Coumadin, 
which has likely further exacerbated her intracranial hemorrhage.   
Our plan will be as follows:
1. She was given factor VII therapy at 40 mcg/kg.  She appears to be 
tolerating
