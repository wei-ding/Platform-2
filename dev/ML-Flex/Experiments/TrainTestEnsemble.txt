# This experiment demonstrates how a train/test experiment can be performed where multiple algorithms are used. Classification will be performed for individual classification algorithms, and then ensemble-learning methods will be used to make aggregate predictions. Specifying the number of folds as "1" indicates that train/test validation will be used.
