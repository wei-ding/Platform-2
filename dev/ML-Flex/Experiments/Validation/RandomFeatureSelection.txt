# This experiment is used for validation to test a scenario where relatively poor accuracy is expected. This helps verify that ML-Flex is behaving the way it should. In this example, the "random" feature-selection algorithm is used. This algorithm randomly ranks data points. The accuracy is expected to be lower than when a valid feature-selection algorithm is used; however, because all variables in Iris are useful, the accuracy is still high (> 0.90).
