This folder contain any files that are needed for external machine-learning implementations that are written in C or C++.

ML-Flex is currently designed to interface with the C5.0 Decision Trees software by Quinlan. This directory contains the necessary files to run the GPL version of C5.0 Decision trees. To enable ML-Flex to interface with this software, it is necessary to run the "compile" script in this directory. In order to run this script successfully, "gcc" and "make" must be installed and accessible. Some warnings will be printed to the screen, but those can be ignored. Note: This script was designed for UNIX-like environments, but it can be modified to work on Windows if necessary (please send questions to the mailing list).
