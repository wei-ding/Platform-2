This folder (and its subfolders) contain the Java source code for the ML-Flex software. ML-Flex was developed primarily using the IntelliJ (http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) integrated development environment, and IntelliJ project files are included to enable other developers to do the same.

The individual Java files contain headers describing their purpose. In particular, the classes prefixed with "Abstract" can be extended with novel functionality to work easily within the ML-Flex framework.
