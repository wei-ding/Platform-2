# This experiment uses data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (http://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov), a U.S. government-sponsored project that is accumulating various types of data for patients who have had various types of cancer. This includes clinical/demographic/treatment data and high-throughput molecular data. A small subset of the data are included in this experiment for demo purposes. In particular, this experiment demonstrates how to use ML-Flex when you have multiple, distinct sets of independent variables for a given data instance (patient). It's also an example where the dependent variable (patient survival time) is continuous; these values are converted to discrete values (based on the median) before classification is performed. Finally, it shows how to specify a metadata processor.
