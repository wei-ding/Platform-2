# This experiment demonstrates how a train/test experiment can be performed and specific data instances are assigned to the training or testing folds. The data instance IDs are specified in text files. Note that the IDs coincide with IDs that will be generated by ML-Flex when it parses iris.arff (because ARFF files don't contain an ID for instances).
