/**
 * Created by w.ding on 16/02/15.
 *
 * This is a transform rule that support Beta testing on production. When you change the API that is backward
 * compatible, you can test it on your local and then deploy it on production for testing. For certain loyal users
 * or employees, you can give them a role called betaTester in their profile. This rule will be applied before
 * API end point is reached, so that the end point can be version 1 which has no betaTester role and version 2 which
 * has betaTester role. In normal case, it will route to rule class HelloWorld.class or HelloWorld1.class if the user
 * is betaTester. Once beta testing is done, you can route all traffic to HelloWorld1.class. Later on, you want to change
 * the rule again you can create HelloWorld2.class and route betaTester to it. This can goes on and on.
 *
 * Please note: Beta testing is only for backward compatible changes. If not, one should have two versions of clients
 * to connect to two different API class in different packages.
 *
 * When set up this rule, you should have two entries in transformData beta and production to point to the right
 * class name of the rules.
 *
 * For example, for HelloWorldRule and HelloWorld_1Rule, we have the following setup in the request transformer.
 * {
 *   "production": "helloWorld",
 *   "beta": "helloWorld_1"
 * }
 *
 * AccessLevel N as it is internal.
