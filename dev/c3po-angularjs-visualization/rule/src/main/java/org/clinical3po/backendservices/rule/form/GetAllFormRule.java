 * Created by w.ding on 9/4/2015.
 *
 * Is there a way to verify that the memoryImage is in sync with db?
 * In that case, we don't need to reload from db every time this rule is executed.
 * What we can do is to load all forms in the beginning when server starts, and make
 * sure all the form updates are gone through these set of rules.
 *
 * AccessLevel R [user, admin, formAdmin]
